# 📊 Student Performance Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project presents a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow applied to a student performance dataset.
The main objective is to investigate how various demographic and socio-economic factors influence academic outcomes — specifically **math**, **reading**, and **writing** scores.

The analysis demonstrates essential **data science techniques**, including data preparation, descriptive analytics, and visual storytelling — making it an excellent **portfolio project** for aspiring data analysts or data scientists.

## ✨ Key Features

The project adheres to a standard data analytics workflow, emphasizing structured exploration and clear insights:

* **Data Acquisition & Quality Assessment:**
    Initial inspection for data integrity, structure, and types.

* **Descriptive Statistics:**
    Computation of central tendencies, spread, and score distributions.

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
    Handling of missing data, duplicate entries, and categorical normalization.

* **Comparative Analysis:**
    Evaluation of how academic scores vary across categorical dimensions:
    * **Gender** – Score distribution comparison between male and female students.
    * **Parental Education** – Influence of parents’ education level on student outcomes.

* **Data Visualization:**
    Effective visual communication using:
    * **Boxplots:** To highlight score variance and median differences.
    * **Pie Charts:** To illustrate student distribution by ethnic groups.

## ⚙️ Setup & Execution (Google Colab)

Designed for **Google Colab**, the setup is simple and requires no local configuration.

### 1️⃣ Launch the Environment

* Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* Create a **new notebook** and connect to a runtime.

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Google Colab comes preloaded with the required libraries.
However, you can manually install them if needed:

```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
````

### 3️⃣ Import Libraries

At the beginning of your notebook:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

```

### 4️⃣ Load the Dataset

You can upload your dataset manually to Colab or access it from Google Drive:

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

df = pd.read_csv('/data.csv')
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential next steps include:

  * **Predictive modeling** using regression or classification techniques.
  * **Feature importance analysis** via tree-based models.
  * **Integration of socio-behavioral factors** (e.g., study hours, extracurricular participation).
